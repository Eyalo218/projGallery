I missed the part that i needed to put flag with Right click, and i used the CTRL + leftCLick instead.
(noticed till it was late to fix it)
to put flag, hold the ctrl button and normal click..
also i wrote a comment about that just above the cellCLicked function (just incase you'll miss that one);
to win - put flags on all the mines.

Thank you and sorry =D
